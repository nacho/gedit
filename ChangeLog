1999-04-09 Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* Mooooo! Plugins!!!! Hurrahh! Except the only plugin really working
	  is E-Mail, but that doesnt add or edit any docs.
	
	* gE_document.c: (gE_window_new) Removed old code (which was
	  commented out). 
	  Changed the GSlist lookup to not check `plugins' but `plugin_list'.
	  FIxed the hash table to use the GnomeApp arg.
	  Dropped the gE_window. 
	  Added function wide statusbar.
	
	* gE_mdi.h: Internationalisation stuff for the menus.
	  (gE_document_create_view) Brought back the hash table stuff for the 
	
	* gE_plugin_api.c: (add_plugin_to_menu) gnome_app_insert_menus replaced
	  with gnome_app_insert_menus_with_data, we should send the gE_data.
	  the plugin_register (...) call should send a mdi->active_window, not
	  data->window.

1999-04-08 (23:39) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_mdi.c: Fixed the popup menu entries for the internationalisation
	  translation thingies..

1999-04-08 (15:05) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* menus.c: Instead of sending GE_DATA gpointers, send NULL. The
	  gE_data pointers dont do anything. THis was adding to our 
	  original save problems.

	* commands.c: Ok i fixed the Save As bugs. Ok, installed a 
	  global pointer for each dialog (save and open). Now, instead
	  of packing them into a gE_data (which was borking up before)
	  we just reference these global dialogs...
	  (..) Removed masses of code in the file op's callbacks that was
	  making gE_data's.. we don't need them now.
	  (file_open_ok_sel) Made a static void, instead of a gint function.
	  (file_save_cb) 
	  (file_saveas_ok_sel) Made a void, instead of a gint.
	
	* gE_mdi.c: (gE_add_view) Set the changed_id of the view to the same
	  as the one in the original child. Now I just have to implement 
	  keeping the views in sync with each other.

1999-04-07 (15:13) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_files: Tidied up code. Removed old, commented out, cruft.
	  (gE_file_open) We only use the second method of opening a
	  file, why keep the first method!?

1999-04-07 (14:37) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* commands.c: (file_save_cb) Check whether the file has been
	  changed before saving.

1999-04-07 (14:12) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_mdi.c: (gE_document_create_view) Removed the doc->changed
	  and doc->changed_id settings from this function. Should fix
	  some of the add_view problems.
	 (gE_document_init) Added the doc->changed_id signal
	  connection that was in gE_document_create_view.
	
	* gE_mdi.c: Uncommented the view menu options. At least the
	  changed flags should be ok now.

1999-04-06 (15:57) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* main.h: Added GtkWidget *scrwindow member to the gE_document
	  struct.
	
	* gE_mdi.c: Replaced table with a Scrolled Window for the text
	  entry area. Now we can resize and keep the scroll bar, also
	  means we don't have to add a vscrollbar ourselves, making the
	  code leaner and lighter.
	
	* gE_document.c: (gE_document_set_split_screen) Re-Implemented
	  split-screen toggling. The Split-Screen mode is (kinda) back.
	
1999-04-06 (15:28) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* main.h: Added a gE_search member to the gE_document struct.
	
	* gE_mdi.c: (gE_document_init) Initialise the gE_search member.
	
	* search.c: Made all search functions use the gE_search member of
	  the current gE_document, instead of the current gE_window.

1999-04-06 (13:56) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_prefs_box.c: Added MDI Page. We can now set the MDI mode and
	  keep it over sessions of gEdit.
	
	* gE_prefs.c: Get/Save MDI mode settings.
	
	* gE_prefslib.c: (gE_prefs_get_default) Added default setting for
	  MDI mode.

1999-04-04 (14:57) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_files.c: Moved fcntl.h under the sys/types.h so it can compile on
	  OS/2/EMX (Thanks to Asbjoern Pettersen <ape@spacetec.no>).

1999-04-04 (13:59) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* README: Updated Mailing List and email address.
		  Upped version number to 0.5.2
	
	* INSTALL
	  makeconfig.pl: Upped version numbers to 0.5.2
	
	* gE_init.[ch]: Removed old, unused source files

1999-04-03 (15:57) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* commands.c: (child_switch) Fixed the function for GnomeMDI.. it now
	  sets the gEdit window title with the name of the doc as it did before
	  GnomeMDI was introduced - One problem, the titlebar flickers when you
	  change the child.
	
	* gedit.c: (main) Don't send a window pointer to the child_changed signal,
	  no pointer at all is needed in fact.
	
	* gE_mdi.c: Removed unneeded debug output.

1999-04-03 (15:30) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>
	
	* gE_mdi.c:  (gE_document_create_view) Removed the signal connections
	  that connect doc_insert_text_cb and doc_delete_text_cb.. It seems
	  they were for Undo/Redo, but i'm sure there are easier/better ways
	  to implement this. So there are no more Gtk-CRITCAL errors anymore!
	
1999-04-03 (14:47) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>
	
	* gE_mdi.c: Commented out the view_menu.. the Add View and Remove
	  View functions are completely borked.. The implementation is
	  completely different to the way GHex implements it.. maybe Jaka
	  could have a look?
	
1999-04-03 (13:16) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>
	
	* gedit.c: (main) Don't send a GE_DOCUMENT reference to add_view.. 
	  Otherwise we get a Gtk-WARNING on startup...
	
1999-04-03 (00:25) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>
	
	* commands.[ch]: (auto_indent_cb) Added extra arg to the function, so
	  we dont set the int *pos to 0 by accedent.

1999-04-02 (23:53) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_mdi.c: (gE_document_create_view) Reactivated the signal connection
	  for "insert_text"... now i just get Gtk-CRITICAL errors from
	  gtk_text_set_point.. maybe its not referencing the TextWidget
	  properly.. even tho the auto indent itself is working.. grr..
	
	* commands.c: (auto_indent_cb) !data->window->auto_indent should be
	  !settings->auto_indent.. turning auto indent off should work now,
	  as soon as i get the rest of auto indent implemented

1999-04-02 (23:40) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_mdi.c: (gE_add_view) This is pretty much a kludge. Just the same
	  as the old file_open_in_new_win_cb function (commands.c)..

1999-04-02 (23:22) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* commands.c: (gE_event_button_press) Put the debug output of this
	  function into an #ifdef..

1999-04-02 (23:07) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* gE_mdi.c: Added replacement to the context popup menu for the text
	  widget. Now in a Gnome Popup menu, with spiffy stock pixmaps :)
	  (gE_document_create_view) Attached the popup menu GnomeUIINFO to the
	  text widget.
	  
	* commands.c: (edit_cut_cb, edit_copy_cb, edit_paste_cb, edit_selall_cb)
	  Replaced gnome_app_error with gnome_app_flash.. how the hell did that 
	  get there?! I must have been tired when I wrote that! ;)

1999-03-27 (20:18) Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>

	* commands.c (doc_insert_text_cb) removed some really annoying debug 
	  message.
	
	* gE_prefs_box.c: (gE_window_refresh) Re-implemented statusbar visibility
	  refreshing from the prefs box.

1999-03-20 (19:40) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* menus.c:
	  commands.[ch]: (window_new_cb): Use gnome_mdi_open_toplevel() to create a
	  new window. We now have the "Create new window" feature back! YAY!

	* gE_mdi.[ch]:
	  gedit.c: (main) Added signal connections for add_view and add_child. They
	  dont do anything yet, and i'm not sure if they ever will.

1999-03-16 (20:46) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_mdi.c: (gE_add_view) Duplicate the text from the child into the new
	  view. They don't simultaineously update tho.. Checking if the document has
	  changed is working again tho :) 

1999-03-14 (23:46) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_prefs.c: (get_settings)
	  gE_document.c: (gE_window_set_status_bar) Use current (mdi)active_window
	  to access the builtin GnomeApp statusbar member. Statusbar toggle is back!
	  yay! Window doesnt refresh tho, leaving a gap (until the window is resized
	  that is).. Ah well..
	
1999-03-14 (19:46) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* commands.c: (file_quit_cb) If user presses cancel on mdi_remove_all, then
	  we shouldn't close the app! And so, we don't.
	
1999-03-14 (19:01) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* main.h:
	  gE_document.c:
	  gE_files.c:
	  commands.[ch]: Converted all the respective recent document functions to
	  using GnomeApp pointers, instead of gE_window's. Recent Documents list
	  is back! Yay!

1999-03-14 (18:02) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_document: (gE_document_set_read_only) Use gnome_mdi_child_set_name
	  instead of setting the old (now defunct) tab label. 
	  Read Only documents are BACK! yay!

1999-03-14 (00:02) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gedit.c: (main) Doh.. open the toplevel first, before makeing a new
	  document.. Now we don't get two windows open on startup (if we specify
	  a file to open, or just have a plain file on startup).. Yippee!

1999-03-13 (23:46) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* menus.c:
	  commands.[ch]: Document tab positioning is back.. Kinda.. If you change
	  the tab position, you need to make a new MDI window.
	
	* gE_document.c: (gE_window_new) I've commented out the Recent_Document list
	  update call, until i get that fixed with MDI. This stops most of the
	  menus warnings on startup.
	
	* gE_plugin_api.[ch]: (add_plugins_to_window) Send a "GnomeApp" to this
	  and the functions after this. This sort of fixes the startup menu 
	  warnings (well.. atleast they're different ones now ;).

1999-03-13 (19:37) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_mdi.c: (remove_doc_cb) Now we ask the user if they want to save the
	  document if it has been modified. Unfortunatly, if the doc is Untitled,
	  it won't ask for a filename, it'll just close the file... :(
	
1999-03-13 (16:12) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* commands.c: (doc_changed_cb) Get the name from the actual MDI Child, not
	  from the document's filename.
	  (file_open_ok_sel): Check if there is a current document, then check if
	  that document has been modified. If the doc has been modified, or if there
	  aren't any current documents, make a new one (w/ file).

1999-03-13 (15:46) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* menus.c:
	  gE_mdi.c: Moved Edit menu tree. It gets created when a new document
	  is made; along with the View tree. This looks a lot neater.
	
	* makeconfig.pl: Taken out references to the old 'WITHOUT_GNOME' system
	  of pre-0.5.0. And removed the old Gtk+ cehcking, its all done by the
	  Gnome now. Much nicer.. yeah..

1999-03-13 (00:55) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_document.c: Default window size (630,390) is BACK! yay!
	
	* gedit.c: Took out the gE_document_current reference, we can now load files
	  from the command line again. Yippee!

1999-03-12 (19:09) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_mdi.c: (gE_document_create_view) The document being created is now
	  built from the MDIChild specified in the function arguments. Instead of
	  a fresh new gE_document; Now the text widget is being created properly,
	  and file loading and saving now works again.. yay!
	
	* gE_mdi.c: Added creation of View menu to menubar, only problem is that
	  the file doesnt get recreated properly when a new view is added; And a new
	  window seems to get created when the first new document is added (on 
	  startup)...

1999-03-12 (18:25) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>
	
	* toolbar.h:
	  gedit.c: The Toolbar has returned :]

1999-03-12 (18:00) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gedit.c:
	  menus.c: Added Files menu, for use with MDI..

1999-03-11 Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* I've been working on adding GnomeMDI to gEdit since the last entry.

	* gE_mdi.[ch]: New files, containing the new gE_document class definition
	  to work with GnomeMDI. This is the main work towards the new GnomeMDI
	  stuff in gEdit. Work on this is based upon Ghex (and GTop)
	  
	* I've moved gE_document_new* and gE_document_current to gE_mdi.[ch].
	
	* gedit.c: Converted to using GnomeMDI.. so we initialise the MDI system
	  here. Also includes the signals for new documents, chaning views, etc.
	
	* There's more.. but basically just MDI stuff..
	
1999-03-10  Tomislav Vujec  <tvujec@carnet.hr>

	* aclocal-include.m4 (AM_ACLOCAL_INCLUDE): Add ACLOCAL_FLAGS in
	ACLOCAL. This allows maintainer rules to work if any of the macros
	change.

1999-03-10  Tomislav Vujec  <tvujec@carnet.hr>

	* gnome.m4 (GNOME_INIT_HOOK): Wrapped position parameter in
	testing for additional inits. It gets expanded while generating
	configure, resulting in an empty parameter list - syntax error in
	for statement.

1999-03-09  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* gnome.m4 (GNOME_INIT): Add a new paramater, which is passed to
	GNOME_INIT_HOOK. 
	(GNOME_INIT_HOOK): New parameter "additional inits".  This is a
	list like "applets capplet", and the corresponding
	GNOME_APPLETS_LIBS and GNOME_CAPPLETS_LIBS are defined.

1998-03-01  Mark Crichton <crichton@gimp.org>

	* gnome-objc-checks : Added HAVE_GNOME_OBJC conditional

1999-02-27 (22:19) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* README*:
	  INSTALL:
	  makeconfig.pl: Upped version to 0.5.1
  
1999-02-27 (15:49) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Eek.. so much i have done.. Here's a summary:
	 
	 * gE_prefs_box.c: Implemented 'No Plugins' toggle button, this erases
	   all plugins from the "Plugins" menu, and sets a config flag for 
	   using plugins to -1 and the Clist is deactived.
	   When the toggle button is activated the linked
	   list of plugins is reset and reloaded; The config flag is then set to
	   1 and the Clist becomes active once again.
	   When a plugin is added, the list of plugins is saved (incase gEdit is
	   nuked).
	   The toggle button isn't attached to the Apply preferences button, as
	   weird stuff happens to the list and more plugins are added!
	 
	 * plugin.c: Checks for the -1 flag, if it IS -1 then the list of plugins
	   is loaded, but no plugins are actually initialised and so the "Plugins"
	   menu doesn't get populated.
	   Commented out some g_free()'s, seems the variables partly and 
	   partly->buff arent being malloc'ed properly, and so causing gEdit to
	   segfault!
	 
	 * gE_about.c: Commented out the "#ifdef ENABLE_NLS", it seems to make 
	   gEdit stop responding and not display the About box.

1999-02-27 (12:22) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* commands.c: gtk_editable_cut_clipboard doesnt need GTK_CURRENT_TIME
	  (or whatever it's called) anymore, since 1.2 (it seems)..

1999-02-21 Michael Fulbright <drmike@redhat.com>
	* made spec file generated and tweaks slightly
	
1999-02-18 (19:46) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Makefile.am: gedit.desktop goes into 
	  $(datadir)/gnome/Applications now...
	
1999-02-13 (01:49) Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* plugin.c: Figured why custom plugins weren't working properly..
	  plugin_query() was being called, which called 
	  custom_plugin_new_with_query and had PLUGINDIR as the path..
	  plugin_query now calls that custom_plugin function with "" as the 
	  path, and when a plugin is added the full path is included in the
	  plugin_name.. not just the file name.. 
	  It fully works now.. been getting annoyed with this for the past
	  fortnight! Argh!

1999-02-05  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* plugin.[ch]: Added custom_* for plugins in places other
	  than $PLUGINDIR..
	
	* plugin.[ch]: plugin_load_list() and plugin_save_list()... new functions.
	  They load and save the list of plugins currently in use into the
	  Editor_Plugins Gnome config file.. if there is no list, the default 
	  plugins are loaded (from $PLUGINDIR)..

	* plugin.h: Added plugin_list_data and plugin_list as Linked Lists
	  for the plugins running, and their locations..
	
	* plugin.h: (extern plugin_callback_struct pl_callbacks): Added
	  as a global setup of plugins callbacks (setup in gedit.c, 
	  s/callbacks/pl_callbacks)... Whenever a new plugin is loaded, 
	  pl_callbacks must be referenced; or new sets of callbacks could
	  be setup in the application.
	
	* gE_prefs_box.c: Added Plugins section.. with a CList holding all the
	  plugins loaded (via the Linked List setup above, from the custom_*
	  functions in plugin.[ch])..
	  Adding a plugin calls custom_plugin_query(..) which adds the plugin
	  to the menu and adds it to the List of plugins..
	
	* All this code i have added, _should_ work in GO and GWP, as long as
	  they use the same kind of plugin.[ch] interface...

1999-02-04  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gedit.spec: Got this working.

1999-02-04  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* src/gE_prefs.c:
	  src/gE_prefs_box.c: Fixed the statusbar toggle - it wouldn't come
	  back on once you turned it off, exited, and came back in.

	  src/gE_plugin_api.c:
	  src/gE_about.c: 
	  src/dialog.[ch]:
	  src/toolbar.h: Purged Gtk-only code, and removed references to
	  '#ifdef GTK_HAVE_FEATURES_1_1_0' (as we are going Gnome, and Gnome
	  requires  Gtk+ 1.1.x)..
	  (I left #ifdef WITHOUT_GNOME in gE_plugin_api.c (the menus part), for
	  future menu references, it could be useful in the futre)

	* gE_about.c: Added a 'Special Thanks To' to the About Box.. Gtk-Only
	  had it, why shouldn't Gnome-only?
	
	* main.h:
	  gE_about.c: Use VERSION defined in config.h

	* autogen.sh: Changed it to look for makeconfig.pl instead of
	configure.in.

1999-02-02  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* editor-plugins: A copy of the plugins directly from go.  This
	updates automatically.

	* gmodule-plugins: plugins is renamed gmodule-plugins.

	* plugins: Directory renamed gmodule-plugins.

	* .cvsignore: Added configure.in.

	* configure.in, makeconfig.pl: configure.in is now generate by
	makeconfig.pl.  So configure.in is removed and makeconfig.pl is
	added.

	* autogen.sh: Now calls makeconfig.pl and
	editor-plugins/plugins.pl.

	* Makefile.am: Switched from just plugins to editor-plugins and
	gmodule-plugins.

1999-01-30  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/commands.[ch]:
	* src/gE_document.[ch]:
	* src/gE_prefs.c:
	* src/gedit.c: Added the ability to drag files from gmc (or any other
	gnome filemanager that drag and drops) into a gEdit window, and have
	it open the dragged files, thanks to a tip from Miguel.

1999-01-27  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/Makefile.am:

	  src/gE_prefslib.c:
	  src/gedit.c:
	  src/main.h:
	  src/menus.c:
	  src/plugin.[ch]: Lots and lots of code cleanup. Mostly just removing
	left over gtk-only code, but I also removed the scrollball (since it
	doesn't really work in a one-dimension environment. Please email me if
	any problems pop-up after this commit.

	* TODO: Updated it.

1999-01-20  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* src/gE_prefs_box.c (gE_prefs_dialog): Connected the help signal
 	of the GnomePropertyBox to gnome_help_pbox_display.

1999-01-17  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>
	
	* src/menus.c: Added "Find Line..." to Edit menu.. Hope Nat doesn't
	  mind this addition (having to use it via usual Find is annoying)..

	  and off.

	been replaced with "_Plugins".

1999-01-17  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Makefile.am: Removed msgbox.c and msgbox.h from it.

1999-01-17  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* commands.c:
	  gE_document.c:
	  gE_files.c:
	  gE_init.c:
	  gE_prefs.c:
	  gedit.c:

	* src/commands.[ch]:
	  src/gE_document.c: Switched the auto_indent callback to connect to
	  the insert_text signal instead of key_press_event - problems with
	  the notebook intercepting the signal vs. the keyboard accelerator's
	  not working should be fixed.

1999-01-08  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* src/menus.c: Added accelerators to the toggles.

1999-01-08  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	  version.

1999-01-07  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* src/menus.c: Pass three arguments to GNOMEUIINFO_MENU_NEW_ITEM,
 	and use the new PRINT_ITEM.

 	GNOMEUIINFO_MENU_ITEM macros instead.

1998-12-21  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* src/commands.c: Recent Documents wasnt calling the File menu as
	_File.. all fixed now.. no more menu warnings.. it still segfaults for
	me... argh...

1998-12-21  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* src/gE_plugin_api.c: (add_plugin_to_menu) "Plugins" -> "_Plugins"..

1998-12-16  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/gedit.c: Ditched all the signal handling crap.

1998-12-16  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* xpm/tb*.xpm: Reduced all the toolbar xpms to 8 colors
	  apiece, to reduce the load time.

	* src/toolbar.c: Further cleanups to the toolbar code, getting
	  it to resize properly, etc.

	* src/gE_prefslib.c: Fixed one or two bugs in it. I forget
	  what they were ATM :)

	* src/gE_prefs_box.c: Fixed it so the OK button works properly in
	  the GTK-only version now.

	* THANKS: Added Christopher (raistlinn) to it, for his help
	  yesterday.

	* gedit.spec: Updated this for 0.4.8.

	* src/gE_document.c: Bug fixes so the prefernces load properly in
	  the gnome version now. Also fixed some resize problems that were
	  bugging me in the gtk-only version.

	* src/commands.c: Another bug fix, this time to keep the recent
	  documents from overwriting Exit... This was a bug I introduced in one
	  of my recent commits.

1998-12-15  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gedit.keys: new file, for mime stuff...

1998-12-13  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>
	
	* src/commands.c:
	  src/gE_document.c:
	  src/gE_files.c:
	  src/gE_prefslib.c
	  src/gedit.c:
	  src/search.c: Fixed mem leaks, free mem reads, etc that yosh
	  found with purify. Thanks man! :) There are still some mem leaks
	  in plugin.c, and gE_plugin_api.c that Chris and I, respectively,
	  need to fix.  If people could test the changes out to verify
	  I didn't break anything, that would be great.

Sat Dec 12 21:08:14 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	  when you tried to close the second one.
	
	* src/menus.c: Changed File->Quit to File->Exit to be SG compliant.
	
	* KNOWNBUGS: Updated it to reflect recent changes.

1998-12-11  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/commands.c:
	  src/search.c:
	  src/gE_print.c: Fixed up some dialogs to use gnome_dialog if gnome
	  is being used.
		
	* src/gE_prefs_box.c: Fixed it so changes to the font take effect on
	  *all* documents in the current window, not just the current document.

	* src/msgbox.c: Fixed it up to use normal text widget routines to truncate
	  the msgbox, and not do weird internal crap. Speaking of which, we should
	  probably phase out the msgbox RSN, since it doesn't seem to have much of
	  a purpose.
  
1998-12-10  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/search.c:
	  src/search.h:
	  src/gE_document.c: Added the function count_lines_cb, and
	  changed it so the line button on the status bar calls it instead
	  of goto_line_cb. count_lines_cb displays the number of lines in
	  the current document, and the current line number the cursor
	  is on.

	* src/menus.c: Added "Search for Line..." to the Search menu, and
	  added the _'s to main items on the menu bar to allow for keyboard
	  navigation. _This will probably break some internationalization_

1998-12-07  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/gE_files.c:
	  src/commands.c: Fixed some more stuff with the titlebar..
	* src/gE_document.c: Removed the Line indicator label, since it
	  doesn't display the correct line number.
	* src/gE_about.c: Fixed the gnome version.
	* src/gE_plugin.h:
	  src/gE_plugin_api.c: Mostly caught up to Chris's additions to
	  the plugins api - set_selected_text, get_selected_text,
	  get_point, etc... This means that Test Selection works now :)
	* README: Did some editting on it - changed the stuff that was
	  innaccurate or didn't make sense.. 
	
1998-12-05  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* src/commands.c: Tried to remove the weird code that makes the gEdit
	  window hide when you Quit and there are modified files, it was very
	  disorientating.. to me at least... still something wrong with it
	  though (the window moves if you click cancel)...

1998-12-05  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* plugins/browse: new, Web Browser, plugin; using Lynx...
	
1998-11-29  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* src/main.h:
	  src/gE_document.c:
	  src/gE_prefslib.c:
	  src/gE_prefs.c:
	  src/gE_prefs_box.c: Implemented Scrollball and Split-Screen in the
	  preferences dialog... Split Screen can now be properly turned on and
	  off, unlike in previous times...

1998-11-27  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/gE_document.c: Fixed it so the titlebar displays
	  the filename, then GEDIT_ID, not the other way around.

	* src/commands.c: Added accelerators for keyboard navigation
	  to the Recent Documents list in the File menu.

	* src/toolbar.c: Some minor tweaks to the relieved toolbars in the
	  GTK-only version.

	* src/gE_prefs_box.c: Added frames and other such niceties to make
	  the dialog look a little more appealing.

	* src/search.c: Fixed some bugs that have been bugging me - it no
	  longer erases the previous search string unless you've actually
	  switched to another mode (text vs. line), and, when Searching 
	  (not Search and Replacing) it will act as though you clicked OK
	  when you press enter.

	* src/main.h: Added another #define for WITHOUT_GNOME to do with
	  internationalization.

	* xpm/tb_prefs.xpm: Fixed it so it's transparent.

Thu Nov 26 19:30:08 EST 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* src/gE_files.c : clist updates to bring into sync with gtk 1.1.5

1998-11-19  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/gE_prefslib.c: More fixes to the prefs system - it
	seems to be working correctly now...

1998-11-18  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* src/menus.c: Ditched the foot menu - it's a great
	UI idea, but it needs to be done properly in gnome-app,
	and is just confusing people ATM
	
	* src/gE_prefslib.c: Fixed some things that had broken
	GTK-only prefs - it's still not perfect, but sorta kinda
	works now. Let me know specifics on what's wrong with it,
	if you can find any.

1998-11-15  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* src/gE_prefs_box.c: Prefrerences now work in non-Gnome
	  (it's taken me over 3 hours to get this damn thing to work!)..

1998-11-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* src/gedit.c (main): Switched to popt.

1998-10-31  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Tidied up Make warnings... Clean build on all ports..

1998-10-29  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Upped version numbers to 0.4.8 (in anticipation of next release)

1998-10-29  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_document.c: When you change document, titlebar changes with the
	  filename...

1998-10-28  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* toolbar.c: Added Quit button...

1998-10-27  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

1998-10-25  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_document.c: (gE_document_set_read_only): Changes File label to
	  show a visible reminder that the file open is Read-Only or not..
	  (**FIX-ME** This is kinda broke on Untitled files ;)...

1998-10-25  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed 'gEdit unable to compile with Gtk+ 1.0.x' bug.. Modified LOTS
	  of files.. mostly putting in '#ifdef GTK_HAVE_FEATURES_1_1_0' -
	  Please remember people.. If you add any Gtk+ 1.1.x ONLY things, 
	  please put in #ifdef GTK_HAVE_FEATURES_1_1_0, some people only run
	  Gtk+ 1.0.x, and dont want the hastle of using Gtk+ 1.1.x (and having
	  Gimp broken ;)...

1998-10-24  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	- Bah... lets remember...
	* toolbar.c: (gE_create_toolbar): Checks preferences file for haveing
	toolbar buttons reliefed... if TRUE, sets RELIEF, if FALSE, does
	nothing..
	
	* toolbar.[ch]: tb_relief_on/tb_relief_off : new callbacks for menu
	
	* menus.c: Added tb_relief_on/off to Toolbar menu...
	
	- (Relief only works with Gtk+ 1.1.x)

1998-10-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* src/gE_plugin.c (load_library): Call g_module_make_resistent ().

	* src/gE_plugin.h (GE_PLUGIN_LOG_DOMAIN): Define to `gEdit-Plugin'.
	If included from a plugin, set G_LOG_DOMAIN to GE_PLUGIN_LOG_DOMAIN
	and include <gnome.h> after that.

	* src/geditrc: New file.
	* src/msgbox.c (msgbox_create): Change widget name and call
	gtk_widget_ensure_style () to load a style from the geditrc.

	* src/msgbox.c (log_handler): New static function.
	(msgbox_create): Call g_log_set_handler () to let non-fatal messages
	go to the message box.

1998-10-23  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* src/gE_plugin.h (gE_Plugin_StartFunc): New function typedef.
	(gE_Plugin): Added `start_func'. This is called to create a new
	instance of a plugin while the `init_func' is only called once
	when the plugin is loaded.

	* src/gE_plugin.c (gE_Plugin_Load): If the plugin is already loaded,
	call it's `start_func'. When first loading the plugin, we only call
	the `init_func' which is responsible for calling the `start_func'.

	* src/gE_plugin_api.c (gE_plugin_create_widget): Added GtkWidget **
	parameter to store the GtkContainer and return the docid.
	(gE_plugin_document_close): Fixed a bug to make this function
	actually work.

1998-10-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* configure.in (HAVE_LIBZVT): New automake conditional. This checks
	for libzvt from gnome-libs/zvt.

	* README.plugins: Added short notice about my new Shell plugin.

1998-10-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Plugins can now use the new gE_plugin_create_widget () function
	to create a document not having a GtkText but a GtkContainer widget
	so they can add an arbitrary child to it.

	* src/main.h (gE_document): Added `viewport', `split_viewport' and
	`split_parent'.

	* src/gE_document.c (gE_document_new): Set `doc->split_parent'.
	(gE_document_set_split_screen): Use `doc->split_parent', if this
	is NULL then we don't have a split screen.
	* command.c (options_toggle_split_screen_cb): Likewise.

	* src/gE_document.c (gE_document_new_container): New function.
	Since larger parts of gEdit rely upon the fact that `doc->text' and
	`doc->split_screen' are GtkText widgets, we need to create them here;
	we just add a newly created GtkViewport to the GtkTable instead of
	the GtkTexts ...

	* src/gE_plugin_api.c (gE_plugin_create_widget): This is a wrapper
	function for gE_document_new_container () that should be used in
	plugins.

	* src/gE_plugin.h (gE_plugin_create_widget): Added prototype.

1998-10-22  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Makefile.am: Few file additions so the RPM would build...
	
	* gedit.spec: New File...

1998-10-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* src/gE_plugin_api.h: Move prototypes of all functions that
	gmodule plugins may use into gE_plugin.h and include this file here.
	
	* src/gE_plugin.h: To avoid problems with plugins accessing internal
	structures of gEdit, declare prototypes of "public" functions they
	can use here. Plugins should not use any function not declared in
	this file or in any file included from this file.

	* src/gE_plugin.c (gE_plugin_get_widget): New function. Returns
	the GtkText widget of the document.

1998-10-18  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Added option to toggle line wrapping in the Text Widget.
	
	* src/main.h (gE_document): Added `line_wrap'.
	* src/gE_document.c (gE_document_set_line_wrap): New function.
	* src/gE_plugin_api.h (gE_plugin_set_line_wrap): New function.

1998-10-15  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_prefs.c:
	* gE_prefslib.c:
	* gE_document.c: (Various Functions): Default preferences, now work..
	
	* gE_prefs_box.c: Removed old Debug code (inserted #ifdef DEBUG's)...

1998-10-14  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* src/gE_plugin.h (gE_Plugin_Object): Removed `config_prefix', this
	is now identically with `config_path'.

1998-10-14  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Added some basic CORBA stuff. CORBA is only used in plugins, but
	we need to initialize it in the main program.
	
	* configure.in (--enable-orbit): New parameter to link with ORBit.
	If found, check for LibGnorba and define two (HAVE_OBIT) and
	(HAVE_LIBGNORBA) automake conditionals. Also AC_DEFINE(HAVE_ORBIT)
	and AC_DEFINE(HAVE_LIBGNORBA) if ORBit/LibGnorba is found.
	Only check for this if the GModule Plugins are enabled.

	* src/Makefile.am (CPPFLAGS): Define `_IN_GEDIT'.
	(gedit_LDADD): Link with ORBit and LibGnorba if they're found.

	* src/gE_plugin.c (gE_Plugin_Load): Pass the edit context to
	the plugin so that it can use the old plugin API as well.

	* src/gE_plugin.h: If we are not _IN_GEDIT, add `extern' declarations
	for the CORBA variables `global_orb', `root_poa', `root_poa_manager',
 	`global_ev' and `name_service' and a prototype for `corba_exception'.

	The following stuff is `#ifdef HAVE_LIBGNORBA':
	
	* src/gedit.c (corba_exception): New function which is used for
	CORBA error handling.
	(global_orb, root_poa, root_poa_manager, global_ev, name_service):
	New global variables which can be used in CORBA-aware plugins.
	(main): Initialize CORBA here.

1998-10-14  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* toolbar.c: Added shortcut to Preferences, new Toolbar button, Prefs..
	
	* xpm/tb_prefs.xpm: New File.. 'Borrowed' from Gnome Stock..
	
	* gE_prefs_box.c: Removed Font 'restart gEdit' label...
	
	* gE_prefs_box.c: (gE_prefs_dialog): Hmm, put get_prefs(data); 
	back in...
	
	* gE_prefs_box.c: (gE_window_refresh): Modified, so that it sets the
	font of the current document to the font set in the Preferences, 
	using this Function means it should also change the font in non-Gnome
	versions of gEdit, this doesn't change the font of ALL the docs open...
	
	* gE_document.c: (gE_document_new): Removed all 'rc' stuff, and
	added some style->font stuff, so it checks what the (gchar *)w->font
	is, and sets the document font to that (w->font is set in the
	Preferences dialog), if that value is NULL it sets to a default font
	of 12pt Courier (and also sets w->font to that)...
	
	* TODO: Some slight modifications, and i checked off the 'Immediate
	Font Changes'

1998-10-14  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	Added GModule Plugins which are dynamically loaded into the
	running GEdit process. This has the advantage that the plugin
	can access Gtk and Gnome structures like widgets directly and
	we don't need to implement a rather complex interface.

	Look at plugins/gmodule_plugin_howto for details about this
	plugin interface.

	* configure.in (--with-gmodule-plugins): New parameter to
	enable the new GModule Plugins. Disabled by default. If
	enabled, AC_DEFINE(WITH_GMODULE_PLUGINS).
	(WITH_GMODULE_PLUGINS): New automake conditional.

	Changes to existing code:
	
	* gE_plugin_api.c (start_plugin): Call gE_Plugin_Load () for
 	plugins of type PLUGIN_GMODULE.

	* plugin.h (PluginType): Added `PLUGIN_GMODULE'.
	(plugin_info): Added `user_data' which is a gpointer.

	* gedit.c (prog_init, main): Call gE_Plugin_Query_All ().

	Newly added files:

	* gE_plugin.h: This is installed in `$(includedir)/gedit' and is
	included both in GEdit and the plugins.
	(gE_Plugin_Info): New struct typedef.
	(gE_Plugin_Object): New struct typedef.

	* gE_plugin.c (gE_Plugin_Query_All): This is used to read all plugin
	description files and add the plugins to the Plugins menu.
	(gE_Plugin_Query): Query a single plugin and call gE_Plugin_Register
	on it, but do not load it into memory.
	(gE_Plugin_Register): This sets up a plugin_info structure for the
	plugin ans calls gE_plugin_program_register () so it will be added
	to the Plugins menu.
	(gE_Plugin_Load): Actually read a plugin into memory and call its
	init function.

1998-10-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* src/plugin.h (plugin_document_callbacks): Added
	`set_auto_indent', `set_status_bar', `set_word_wrap',
	`set_read_only', `set_split_screen' and `set_scroll_ball'.

	* src/gE_plugin_api.c: Added new functions
	`gE_plugin_set_auto_indent', `gE_plugin_set_status_bar',
	`gE_plugin_set_word_wrap', `gE_plugin_set_read_only',
	`gE_plugin_set_split_screen' and `gE_plugin_set_scroll_ball'.

1998-10-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	a gE_document * and a gint indicating whether to enable auto indent.

	* src/command.c (auto_indent_toggle_cb): Call the new
	`gE_window_set_auto_indent' function.

	Moved callback functions from the `Options' menu into command.c
	and called them `options_toggle_*_cb'. They call `gE_document_set_*'
	functions in gE_document.c which provide the functionality the
	callbacks formerly had.

	This means we can more easily use the functionality of the menu
	callbacks to turn things on and off.

	* src/gE_document.c (gE_window_toggle_statusbar): Moved functionality
	of this function into new `gE_window_set_status_bar'.
	(gE_window_set_status_bar): New function taking a gE_window * and
	a gint indicating whether to show or to hide the statusbar.
	(gE_document_toggle_wordwrap): Moved functionality of this function
	into new `gE_document_set_word_wrap'.
	(gE_document_set_word_wrap): New function taking a gE_document * and
	a gint indicating whether to turn word wrap on or off.
	(gE_document_set_readonly): Renamed to `gE_document_set_read_only'.
	(gE_document_set_read_only): Renamed from `gE_document_set_readonly'.
	(gE_document_toggle_readonly): Moved to command.c and renamed to
	`options_toggle_read_only'.
	(gE_document_toggle_scrollball): Moved functionality of this function
	into new `gE_document_set_scroll_ball'.
	(gE_document_set_scroll_ball): New function taking a gE_document *
 	and a gint indicating whether to show or to hide the scrollball.
	(gE_document_set_split_screen): New function taking a gE_document *
 	and a gint indicating whether to enable or disable the split screen.

	* src/command.c (options_toggle_split_screen): Renamed to
	`options_toggle_split_screen_cb'.
	(options_toggle_split_screen_cb): Renamed from
	`options_toggle_split_screen'.
	(options_toggle_scroll_ball_cb): New callback function calling
	`gE_document_set_scroll_ball'.
	(options_toggle_word_wrap_cb): New callback function calling
	`gE_document_set_word_wrap'.
	(options_toggle_status_bar_cb): New callback function calling
	`gE_document_set_status_bar'.

	* src/menus.c: Call the new `options_toggle_*_cb' functions in
	command.c rather than using the `gE_document_*' ones directly.

1998-10-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* src/main.h (gE_document): Added `read_only' flag.

	* src/gE_document.c (gE_document_set_readonly): New function.
	This is the user-level function to make a document readonly; it
	keeps track of the splitscreen.
	(gE_document_toggle_readonly): New function. This is used in the
	menu callbacks and calls gE_document_set_readonly ().
	(gE_document_new): Initialize the `read_only' flag to FALSE.

	* src/gE_files.c (gE_file_open): Use access () to check whether you
	have write permission to the file and make the document readonly
	if not.

	* src/menus.c: Added new `Options/Toggle Readonly' menu item.

1998-10-13  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* src/gE_plugin_api.c (start_plugin): Don't set
	`callbacks.document.open' and `callbacks.document.close'
 	to NULL.

1998-10-09  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* src/gE_prefs_box.c: Whee! The preferences box actually opens again
	  in Gnome version (it does open in non-Gnome right?)

1998-10-03  Chris Lahey  <clahey@jennifer.reshall.umich.edu>

	* src/gE_plugin_api.c: Added functionality for insert.
	
	* src/plugin.c, src/plugin.h: Rewrote plugin.c to not use
	threads and still be robust and expandable.

1998-09-23  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* src/plugin.c (plugin_parse): Set up plugin_parse to better
	handle plugin crashes.  Fixed an overwrite bug that probably
	wouldn't have manifested but deserved to be fixed.

	* src/gedit.c: Added some bizarre includes to get rid of some
	warnings.  Called gdk_threads_leave after gtk_main returned, but
	it probably doesn't matter.

1998-09-23  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* src/plugin.c (plugin_parse): Fixed an overwrite bug.

	* README.plugins (Encrypt): Fixed a typo.

1998-09-22  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* configure.in: Added plugins/client/Makefile and
	plugins/testselect/Makefile.

1998-09-22  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* src/plugin.c, src/plugin.h: Copied from go.  Big changes.  Threaded now.

	* src/gedit.c (setup_callbacks): Added setup_callbacks to put all
	callback initialization in one place.
	: Used the new function everywhere.
	(main): Added thread initialization code.

	* src/gE_plugin_api.c (gE_plugin_program_register): Initialized
	suggested_accelerator to NULL just to make sure that nothing goes
	wrong.

	* src/commands.c: Changed include orders to get it to compile.

1998-09-21  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* msgbox.c: Fixed sigsegv... something wrong with:
	  gtk_adjustment_set_value(GTK_ADJUSTMENT(text->vadj), value);
	  Does anyone actually use the MessageBox?!
	
	* Fixed so anyone using gtk+ >1.0.5 will pass the configure script
	  (but it won't fully compile, someone has left all glib 1.1.x stuff in
	  which is incompatible with 1.0.x!! ack...)

1998-09-17  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_prefs_box.c: Hurrah! The prefs dialog box displays in non-Gnome,
	  now to actually get it to work properly ;)

1998-09-12  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_prefs.c:
	* gE_prefs_box.c: Fixed Font selection bugs...
	

1998-09-12  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* TODO: Updated with new Prefs Dialog info...

	* menus.c:
	* gE_prefs_box.[ch]: Implemented New preferences Dialog (Gnome only)...
	

1998-09-10  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* TODO: Minor updates.... btw, wtf is Andy?!
	* gE_prefslib.c: Stopped sigsegv on my system...

1998-09-07  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (plugindir): Move into $(libdir).
	* src/Makefile.am (plugindir): Likewise.

1998-09-02  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Added the gE_prefslib.[ch] files to cvs. They provide functions for
	  settings preferences for both gnome and gtk versions of gedit...

	* Still todo is create the preferences dialog, and add prefs for split
	  screen, the scrollbar, etc...

1998-09-02  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* commands.c: Semi-Fixed the Read-Only file thing... 
	  A message pops up on the statusbar explaining its Read-Only, then
	  a SaveAs box pops up! whee!....

1998-08-27  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* gE_about.c: Fixed gEdit homepage URL...
	* gedit.c:
	* toolbar.c: Removed annoying Debug code...

1998-08-26  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>
	
	* toolbar.c: Removed occerences of Document List window Toolbar 
	  settings (This was making gEdit sigsegv: Gdk-window: sigsegv..)...
	  
1998-08-26  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* configure.in: Define `WITHOUT_GNOME' if we don't have GNOME.
	(--disable-gnome): Command line parameter to let user disable GNOME.
	(WITH_GNOME): New automake conditional.
	* acconfig.h (WITHOUT_GNOME): New tag.

1998-08-24  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Converted gEdit's source tree into its own Gnome/CVS module...

1998-08-23  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Separated plugins into their own directories

Sat Aug 22 14:33:49 MET DST 1998  Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>

	* commands.c, gE_files.c: replaced basename() by g_basename().

Thu Aug 20 20:25:57 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Restored gtk_widget_grab_focus's, because they seem
	  to work now. (if you update to the latest CVS GTK+)

	* For !WITHOUT_GNOME, don't create the toolbar handlebox
	  ourselves, since gnome-app-helper creates it. Obey
	  the ui_properties setting with respect to toolbar
	  relief.

1998-08-18  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Disabled several gtk_text_grab_focus's until I can figure out why
	  recent changes in gtk cause gEdit to crash.. Owen?

1998-08-1?  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed the recent-list to remove duplicate entries...

	* Added Martin Wahlen's spell-checking plugin to CVS.. We need to
	  add some plugin functions to the API for him, but what's he's got
	  looks great...

	* Committed Dan's latest modifications to the scrollball widget...

1998-08-13  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_document.c: 
	* gE_plugin_api.c: 
	* gedit.c: 
	* gE_init.c: 
	* commands.c:
	Got rid of most of the GINT_TO_POINTER and GPOINTER_TO_INT calls.

1998-08-13  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Following Chris's instructions, made an initial attempt at making the plugins
	  api 64 bit clean...

1998-08-12  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Committed Andy's patch, after making the neccassary modifications
	  to get it to compile for the gnome version...

	* Got a new (better) version of the scrollball widget from Daniel
	  Dunbar, and committed that...

1998-08-11  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* remove "#include "plugin.h" from main.h because the whole world
	doesn't need it.  include it only where needed.

	* gE_prefs.[ch]: cleanup.  drop a ton of unneeded cruft.  pretty print.

	* gE_document.c: cleanup gE_window_new().

	* menus.c: (non-Gnome) simplify and drop unnecessary code.  no sorry,
	menu accelerators still don't work.

	* diff.c: drop erroneous printf's.

	* put evan's scrollball menu option in ifdef's for non-Gnome.

	* rename all *_callback routines to *_cb.

	* lots of other misc changes as a result of the above changes...

1998-08-10  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Committed Andy's patch (we do care Andy ;-)

	* Added Toggle Scrollball option to the options menu...

1998-08-10  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* rewrite and improve popup-menu-on-right-mouse-click.  specifically:

		- drop gE_text_popupmenu from main.h.  there is no good reason
		to be storing every widget used to make the popup menu.  all
		that is needed is a pointer to the top-level menu widget.

		- make all the popup menu routines private only within
		gE_document.c because they're never used anywhere else.

		- use a table to generate the menu instead of individually
		adding each one (eliminate repetitive code).

		- when swapping .c and .h files, now swaps .cpp files and
		handles upper/lower case too (e.g., swap .H and .C).

	* menus.c: add ifdef GTK_HAVE_FEATURES_1_1_0 for the split-screen
	menu entry.

	* gE_document.c: code cleanup, reindendation.

	* gE_files.c: drop unused variables from gE_file_open().

	* rename file_open_in_new_win_cmd_callback to file_open_in_new_win_cb.
	it's still a long name, but not ridiculously long. :)

	* add dialog.[ch] to GTK.Makefile.am

	* fix indendation in ChangeLog.

1998-08-09  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Added "Open in new window" to the right-click popup-menu that calls
	  file_open_in_new_win_cmd_callback, so that now you can be editting
	  a file and immediately switch it over to its own window - will also
	  help for when we implement DND to the desktop...

	* Implemented (slightly buggy) split-screen support for users with gtk
	  1.1 - still needs proper prefs implemented, as it's always on at
	  startup now...

1998-08-08  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Committed Andy's patch below, after making the neccassary
	  modifications to the toolbar routines to get the gnome version to
	  work, and removed the plugin changes per Chris's request - he made
	  some changes today that weren't taken into account in the patch...

	* Added the patch from Mikael Hermansson that creates a popup menu
	  when you right click on the text widget, after I moved a couple
	  items around to (I hope - this is debatable) more logical position,
	  and added a couple more functions (Save and Print.) Also added the
	  proper internationalization support for the gnome version...

1998-08-08  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* generalize popup dialog boxes by using a common routine.  currently,
	the search/replace popup, the save-file-on-close popup, and the
	save-file-before-printing popup, use this.

	* improve print routine to be more intelligent and not have to always
	create a temporary file.

	* for non-Gnome version, add floating menubar.  whee

	* moved all search routines out of commands.[ch] to search.[ch].

	* change all assert() statements to g_assert().

	* include plugin patch to cleanup compiler warnings that Alex included
	for 0.4.5, but forgot to commit into cvs.

	* update TODO list

	* new files: dialog.[ch], search.[ch].

	* main.h: drop unused from gE_window struct.  change some gint fields
	back to gboolean, because that's what they are.  add toolbar field
	to gE_window for files_list_window so that main toolbar options
	(on/off, pic/text/both, etc.) also affect the toolbar for the files
	list window.

	* gE_files.c: fix bug where doing a Save after a Save-As would result
	in a bogus filename.

	* toolbar.c: minor code cleanup, including use boolean defs TRUE/FALSE
	instead of 1/0.  i had these here before (see 1998-07-13 entry), but
	alex changed them back to 1/0.

1998-08-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.c: Fixed #include ordering.

1998-08-07  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Made some changes to the way close_execute works, so we could
	  use it in the document_close plugins api.

	* Broke recent-documents. I was trying to fix it so it wouldn't show
	  duplicates of the same document, but screwed some stuff up in the
	  algorythm - nothing real bad, just doesn't work quite right. The
	  reason I'm committing this is so I could commit the above changes..

	* Added the proper api to plugin_document_open and plugin_document_close
	  and had to make a minor modification of close_doc_execute to
	  incorporate them...

	* Temporarily added a gtkscrollball widget immediately above the
	  scrollbar, per Dan Dunbar's request - this is all part of my quest
	  for world domination...

	* Temporarily added a foot/program menu, so as to give the gnome-gui
	  guys something to play with...

1998-08-06  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (process_next): 
	the plugin_document_close function is now required to return a
	bool based on whether the document actually closed.  Returns TRUE
	if the plugin actually closed.
	* plugin.c: Added a document_close function to the API.

1998-07-31  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* fix three bugs reported by Mikael Hermansson:

	    1. opening a file that doesn't exist from the command line
	    results in seg fault.

	    2. doing "Save As" with a new filename results in subsequent
	    "Save" commands failing.

	    3. if quitting gedit and a changed file has not been saved,
	    selecting "Cancel" on the yes/no/cancel save dialog box results
	    in the original window disappearing and never coming back.

	* fix for bug reported by Marin Purgar, where if PLUGINDIR did not
	exist, readdir() causes a segv (e.g., on Linux).

1998-07-29  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed the preferences routines, that had been mysteriously broken,
	  without even a word in this ChangeLog...!

1998-07-29  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Got recent documents working for the gnome version.. Currently you can
	  change the # of documents it displays by redefining the  MAX_RECENT
	  variable.. The default is 4, per the style guide..

1998-07-27  Jaka Mocnik  <jaka.mocnik@kiss.uni-lj.si>

	* main.h: check for #defined GTK_HAVE_FEATURES_1_1_0 instead of
	GTK_HAVE_ACCEL_GROUP.

1998-07-26  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Committed Andy's patch below, and made the necassary modifications
	  to the gnome version - I also moved New Window and Close Window
	  into, logically, the Window menu...

	* Wrote up a TODO file of some of the things I'd like to get done, most
	  of them before 0.5.0...
	
	* After modifying the gnome Makefile.am to reflect Andy's changes,
	  I added his actual Makefile.am as GTK.Makefile.am, so any new gtk-only
	  developers don't have to hack their own..

	* Renamed the plugins_README to README.plugins on CVS...

1998-07-25  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* add a popup window to show files/document list.  includes its own
	mini-toolbar, to let you print/open/save a file shown in the list.
	doc list auto-updates as you open/close/rename files.

	* implement new read/write file algorithms, which should
	read/write large(r) files a LOT faster.

	* add a "Close All Files" command.

	* rework and modularize a lot of code.  consequently, closing
	files/docs and windows, especially if you have a lot files open,
	will "appear" a lot faster now.

	* add message box popup window.  you can see a "log" of gedit
	messages.  e.g., which files were opened, closed, saved, etc.

	* new files: msgbox.c, msgbox.h, xpm/tb_exit.xpm

1998-07-21  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added Evan's email plugin to plugins_README...
	
	* Added a notice in plugins/plugin_howto to add the plugin details
	  to plugins_README (I don't really want to add them myself!)...
	  
	* Fixed Evan's previous addition to ChangeLog...

1998-07-21  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Added the email plugin - it currently grabs the text out of the
	  document, instead of requiring you to save the file first - this
	  does however mean it's affected by the problem in the plugins api
	  wherein not all of the text is grabbed...
	  
	* Fixed the gtk version of the toolbar so it resizes properly when
	  you switch to text/pic only...
	
1998-07-20  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added plugins_README: information on the current plugins included
	  with gEdit...

1998-07-18  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c: Copied the latest versions of these from my copy of
	go.  Lots of changes to increase robustness.

	* gedit.c (parse_an_arg): Added argument parsing code.

1998-07-18  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_plugin_api.c (add_plugin_to_menu): Fixed a problem with
	plugin insertion if using a language other than English.

1998-07-17  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* rework and improve the print routine:
		- rename _file_print() to file_print_execute()
		- creates temporary file a *lot* faster now (dumps all the
		text in one swell foop instead of one character at a time)
		- deletes the temporary file
		- drop a lot of excess/unnecessary variables
		- add a small note that code was borrowed from gIDE
		- misc code cleanup
		- more todo: see file_print_execute() comments in code

	* add a toolbar handle, so you can have floating toolbars.  whee

1998-07-16  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed printing in non-Gnome
	
	* Moved all plugins (and client.[ch]) into plugins/
	  All new plugins must be placed there...
	
	* Added Encrypt/Decrypt plugins... Using ROT13 to encrypt
	  and Caesar to decrypt...

1998-07-15  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Added plugin_program_quit to the plugins api...

	* Fixed main.h file so toolbar.c doesn't give an error about
	  the struct not containing some things..

1998-07-15  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed hello.c: Now works with the current Plugin API! :)
	
	* Print functions work perfectly now (hopefully, i don't
	  have my printer set up properly), and save the print command
	  for the next session of gEdit.

1998-07-14  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Put all Print specific functions, etc, into gE_print.h

	* Started implementing new Print functions, bewarend, it sigsegvs!

1998-07-13  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Implemented Pixmaps only, Text only, or Both to the 
	  toolbar on start up...
	  
	* Modified homepage URL in the About box...
	
	* Upped version to 0.4.5, for next official release...
	
1998-07-13  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* The previous changes to the gnome menu code broke the
	  menus for multiple windows.. Fixed that..

1998-07-13  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	(all changes are not Gnome specific)

	* fix "blinky" label in the about box (gtk-only version).  cleanup
	  and simplify gE_about.c.

	* for now, include pixmap file/description directly into code as
	  default pixmap for toolbar.

	  (new files: xpm/tb_cancel.xpm, xpm/tb_copy.xpm, xpm/tb_cut.xpm,
	  xpm/tb_edit.xpm, xpm/tb_help.xpm, xpm/tb_new.xpm, xpm/tb_open.xpm,
	  xpm/tb_paste.xpm, xpm/tb_print.xpm, xpm/tb_save.xpm,
	  xpm/tb_search.xpm)

	  TODO: allow user configurable path (saved in ~/.gedit) to load
	  user-prefered toolbar pixmaps.

	* for the statusbar label: add gE_msgbar_XXX() routines to manipulate
	  the label.  remembers last label printed and auto-clears the label
	  after a small timeout.

	* cleanup main.h:
	  	- drop unneeded includes.
		- for WITHOUT_GNOME, define auto_indent, show_tabs,
		show_status, and have_toolbar to be gboolean's instead of
		gint's.  define tab_pos to be GtkPositionType instead of gint.
		- move all function prototypes to their respective .h files.
		(new files: gE_about.h, gE_document.h, gE_files.h)

	* where applicable:
		- use GTK_TOP_{TOP,BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT} for notebook tab
		positioning instead of directly using the numeric values.
		- use boolean defs TRUE/FALSE instead of 1/0.
		- drop variable Ctime.  use GDK_CURRENT_TIME instead.
		- include new .h files as needed.
		- use gE_msgbar_XXX() routines as needed.
		- add GPL notice, drop unused, cleanup prototypes.

	* other misc changes (these should go into the log entry for each file
	  when checked into CVS, but we're not doing that too well, so...) :
	  gE_document.c:
		- move destroy_window() to here.  rename to gE_destroy_window().
		- make notebook_switch_page() static.
		- move gE_show_version() to gedit.c
	  gedit.c:
	  	- include new .h files as needed.  drop unused cruft.
		- move gE_show_version() (now static) here.
		- move destroy_window() to gE_document.c.  rename to
		gE_destroy_window().

1998-07-12  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Made corrections to gnome menu code to get it to compile
	  properly with -Wall and -ansi - you still get warnings though
	  due, I think, to gnome's general handling of menus.

	* Fixed it so you can no longer open directories as files -
	  now it switches to that directory like it should.. Also
	  removed file op buttons in the open fileselector, since
	  they're not needed and get in the way..

	* Removed the gtk_idle_add used in command-line loading, so
	  you can load more than one file correctly now..

	* Committed Andy's cool patch below that fixes up a lot of stuff..

1998-07-11  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	(all changes are not Gnome specific)

	* modularize code: move function prototypes for routines in
	  commands.c from main.h into commands.h (new file).
	  include commands.h where needed.  still more to be done...

	* tons of code cleanup to remove compiler warnings.

	* menus.c : restructure entire file for cleaner code.  Gnome
	  and non-Gnome code completely separated.  move menus_items to
	  be a global variable and not contain any references/pointers
	  to parameters passed into menus_init().  this should be done
	  for the Gnome version as well.

	* add "-Wall -ansi -pedantic' to Makefile.am.  this should really be
	  automatically added to CFLAGS if GNU C is detected.  is this a
	  configure.in (autoconf) option?

	* reformatted some entries in ChangeLog file.

1998-07-10  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* New document tabs are automatically switched too now..

	* Changed the statusbar so it's actually a gtk_label,
	  instead of a gtk_statusbar, to fix a mem leak..

1998-07-10  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* I *think* I fixed all the bugs I added in my previous commit...

	* menus.c (gE_menus_init): Added some example code relating to an
	  idea I have about configurability.

	  separator at the bottom of the plugins list.

1998-07-08  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Made some changes to the gtk-only automatic plugin detection,
	  although it's still broken.
	
	* Disabled the CAN_FOCUS flag on the scrollbar, line number button,
	  and notebook tabs (On Chris's suggestion) - makes editting
	  much smoother..
	
	* While I was at it made it so the titlebar changes to reflect the
	  current document tab selected.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_plugin_api.c (add_plugin_to_menu): Fixed the menus to display
	  correctly.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.c (plugin_query_all): Synced up changes from go to have
	  it not detect "." and ".." as plugins.

	* gE_plugin_api.c (add_plugin_to_menu): Added a second GnomeUIInfo
	  to be the GNOME_APP_UI_ENDOFINFO entry.

1998-07-07  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Some changes to the gtk-only menu code, and started
	  on automatic plugin detection...

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (plugin_new_with_query): 
	* client.c (client_init):
	  Added stuff to better support passing parameters to plugins.

	  Made gedit aware of where plugins are installed.

	* plugin.c :
	* plugin.h :
	* client.c :
	* client.h :
	* reverse.c :
	* diff.c :
	* cvsdiff.c : A few new plugin functions.

1998-06-28  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed bug I added in my last change that caused gedit to sigsegv when
	  you closed the window via the window manager.

	* Added a seek_to_line function that will jump the scrollbar to a
	  specified line, to speed up searches, that kind of thing that
	  previously crawled to the proper position.
	
	* Fixed other minor bugs in searching...

1998-06-28  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Removed instances of main_window from gE_file_open and gE_file_save,
	  and fixed the functions to match with their definitions in main.h...

1998-06-26 and 27  Evan Lawrence  <evan@worldpath.net>

	Sifted through all the code and removed all instances of the global
	main_window variable, replacing them with either a gE_window pointer
	or a gE_data pointer. Also added functions to open and close other
	windows, so you don't have to run a separate copy of gedit - still to
	be added are functions to move documents between windows, etc.
	
1998-06-26  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* Makefile.am : 
	* main.h :
	* gedit.c : 
	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): Plugins are now compiled in by
	  default.  Dropped the hello-plugin.

	* configure.in: Checks for gedit.c instead of menus.c.  More unique.

	* plugin.c (process_command): 
	  (plugin_finish): File descriptors for plugins are now freed and
	  gedit doesn't leave zombie processes.

1998-06-26  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (process_command, plugin_register, process_next): 
	  A bit of plugin API expansion.  Broke up the structs a bit.

	* gE_document.c:

	* gE_plugin_api.c:
	  Using those changes.

	* diff.c: New file.  A plugin to do diffs.

1998-06-21  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>
 
       * fix new_pixmap() so that Gtk warning messages go away.
 
       * massive code cleanup:
              - remove all compiler warnings reported by using
                 '-Wall -ansi -pedantic' with gcc v2.8.0
               - simplified code logic in prog_init()
               - fix bug in gE_about_box() where variable 'button' was
                 being used before being initialized.  this caused
                SEGV depending on compiler and compiler options used.
                 basically, if you're lucky, you don't get the SEGV).
               - in gE_about_box(), drop unnecessary calls to
                 gtk_container_add().  were causing GTK warning messages
                 to be printed.
               - fix function prototype for file_close_cmd_callback()
 
       * add ifdef to remap "fatal" signals to their default behavior
         (which will likely cause a core dump).  this was done because
         if you don't compile GDK with debugging enabled (e.g., you didn't
         do "./configure --enable-debug=yes"), GDK automatically catches
         the "fatal" signals and effectively does nothing with them.  gee,
         that's not very helpful.  to get the signals back to their
         regular behavior, define "GDK_IS_BRAINDEAD" in gedit.c.  this is
         only present in main() when WITHOUT_GNOME is defined.
 
       * main.h: drop unused variable gEdit_ID.  move to gE_document.c
         (it's the only place where it's used).
 
       * pretty print main (for WITHOUT_GNOME), gE_about_box() (also
         for WITHOUT_GNOME)
 

1998-06-22  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* toolbar.c: Added internationalization code (N_ repeatedly) for
	the gnome version of the toolbars.

	* commands.c, main.h:
	Made changes to follow api changes to functions
	gtk_editable_{cut,copy,paste}_clipboard.

1998-06-21  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	Heh, I have *not* been adding changelog entries like a good boy,
	so here's a summary of what I've done recently..

	* Commited patch from Andy Kahn that added toolbars, after modifying
	  the buttons on the toolbar.

	* Gnomified the toolbar code, so that it uses the gnome stock pixmaps,
	  and uses some other gnome functions to make it look gnome-like..

	* Rearanged the file menu, cause it didn't look good the way it was.

	* Added search-for-line capabilities to the search feature, and tied
	  the "Line" button on the statusbar to popup the search dialog with
	  search for line selected.

1998-06-20  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added 'Toolbar' to prefs file, if you select 'Turn Off Toolbar'
	  it stys turned off even when you re-start gEdit ('Turn on toolbar'
	  will keep it turned on)...

1998-06-19  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): Changed some code in the
	WITHOUT_GNOME section to support the new accelerator system for
	those with cvs gtk and without gnome.

	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): 
	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (plugin_new): Changed plugin_init to plugin_new.  It
	explains the function much better.

	* hello.c (main): Fixed some segfaults.


1998-06-18  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* menus.c (get_main_menu):
	* main.h: 
	* menus.h: Changes to support both the old and new accelerator
	systems.  Not tested for 1.0 because I only have 1.1.

1998-06-17  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* hello.c (main): Added a check to see if it's being run as a
	plugin.  Also included the proper headers to get read of
	warnings.
	* main.h: Forgot to include plugin.h at the top of main.h.

1998-06-17  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c: New files for plugins.
	* hello.c: The test plugin.  Needs manual compilation still.
	* gE_document.c, main.h: Changed to allow plugin test.  Changes
	are #defined out unless PLUGIN_TEST is defined non-zero.

	In general, this feature is not enabled by default.  This is the
	very first draft, just to make sure the inter process stuff is
	working.  To enable, compile hello.c and install it as
	/usr/local/bin/hello-plugin, uncomment the two new files in
	Makefile.am and define PLUGIN_TEST non-zero near the top of
	gE_document.c and main.h.

1998-06-10  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* menus.c (get_main_menu): 
	* menus.h: 
	* main.h: Switched to new accelerator system.

	* main.h: #included <stdio.h> to get declaration of size_t.

1998-05-28   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Thanx to Eli Miller (spooge, his IRC nick) gEdit will now
	  re-size smaller than its startup size :)

1998-05-26   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed >2 New file bug

	* Fixed the bug wherein gedit was forced to strip non-ascii 
	  letters to keep from crashing on openning binary files,
	  apparently because of a bug in the text widget, (or possibly
	  my code :) that has since been fixed..

	* Synced the Options menu between the GNOME and non-GNOME versions

1998-05-26   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Released 0.4.0 (Non-GNOME)

	* Save/Restore settings! :)

	* Upped version number to 0.4, ready for next release

1998-05-10   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed the bug with gEdit not asking if you want to save modified files when you quit...
	  It's a bit of a hack, but I didn't feel like rewriting a lot of the code from the close routine..

1998-05-09  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added GNOME version number to the title, it looks better with a version number i feel...
	
	* Fixed segfault on startup when using GTK+ 1.1. Hopefully, the bug has gone...

1998-05-03  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed the sigsegv when loading a file from the cmd line.
	   This does break the (already broken because of the .gnome/gtkrc) font settings

Sun May 03 03:17:13  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@fib.hl.no>

	* .cvsignore: New file. Added some files to it as well.

	  window managers (e.g WindowMaker)

1998-04-19   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Fixed the configure.in script to include the GTK+ include directories,
	  (/usr/local/include/glib, etc), and YES we _are_ using gtk-config to
	  get the directories/libraries needed!

	* Agh! Nobody seems to be updating this! Ok, changes since last entry...

       -* Auto-Indent works, but no way to turn it off (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* Flickering of the Line/Column fixed (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* If file from command line doesn't exist, gEdit creates it (evan)

1998-04-16   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Implemented Line/Column display, buggy though, and the Line counter only counts up to the
          height of the text box, so, it doesn't really work(probably to do with the Text Widget,
	  that still needs some development)...

	* Changed gEdit's default Width so 80 characters can be viewed on one
	  line.

	* Applied patch from Nicholas Lamb for better Search and Replace.

	* Added gEdit.desktop for GNOME Panel, for a little GNOMEification of gEdit

1998-04-15   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Added keyboard shortcuts to the search and the 
	  search and replace commands...

	* Improved the About box: added homepage, and GTK Version
	  labels, and added gEdit icon...

1998-04-13   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Changed File Close shortcut to Alt-W...

	* Added support for multiple files from the command line

1998-03-28   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Released 0.3.1

	* Words now wrap onto the next line (Thanks to
	  GTK+-0.99.9)...

	* Converted gEdit to GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake...

	* Hopefully fixed the clipboard bugs, replaced the
	  GDK_CURRENT_TIME with a size_t thingy...

	* Fixed (mostly) the command line bug, you couldn't
	  open a file using a command like 'gedit
	  /etc/resolv.conf' that's fixed...

1998-03-26   <robo@earthling.net>

	* A file opened from the commandline, the tab no longer shows the
	  './' before the filename...

1998-03-25   <robo@earthling.net>
	* Released 0.3

	* Fixed the command line opening bug, now it inserts a './' so when
	  it saves, all it erases from the tab is the './', instead of the
	  whole filename.

1998-03-24   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* It no longer dies a horrible death when you try to save empty
	  files (thanks to Taneli) and behaves quite normally when you open
	  a binary file...

1998-03-23   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* OK, I think I'm done with search and replace, it now
	  has the option to ask before replacing. Next up: fix the binary
	  file bug and apply the patch from Taneli...

1998-03-22   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Just about done with search and replace, just a few niceties to
	  add..

1998-03-15    <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Close will now ask if you want to save
	  before closing a modified file...

1998-03-15    <robo@earthling.net>

	* Woohoo! preferences work!! Now it will read and write ~/.gedit!! :)
 	  You can change the font of the text box (still need to restart
	  gEdit tho,and when you put the text font dialog box up, it puts
	  it back to the default!)

1998-03-13    <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed the save bug... document->filename
	  was going out of scope...
