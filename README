General Information
===================

This is version 2.15.8 of gedit. gedit is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text 
editor for the GNOME environment.

gedit is part of GNOME and uses the latest GTK+ and GNOME libraries.
Complete GNOME integration is featured, with support for Drag and Drop (DnD) 
from Nautilus (the GNOME file manager), the use of the GNOME help system,
the GNOME Virtual File System and the GNOME print framework.

gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets you edit more than 
one document at the same time.

gedit supports most standard editing features, plus several not found in your 
average text editor (plugins being the most notable of these).

gedit plugins may also be written in the python scripting language: to enable
python support you need the pygtk and gnome-python-desktop bindings.

Although new features are always under development, currently gedit has:

    * Complete support for UTF-8 text
    * Syntax highlighting
    * GNOME VFS support for remote files
    * Complete integration with the GNOME Environment
    * Search and Replace
    * File Revert
    * A complete preferences interface
    * Configurable Plugins system, with optional python support
    * Printing and Print Previewing Support


Some of the plugins, packaged and installed with gedit include, among others:

    * Word count
    * Spell checker
    * Change case of selected text
    * Sort
    * Tag list
    * Insert Date/Time
    * Shell output

Other external plugins are also available.


gedit is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2, see

Installation
============

gedit requires GTK+-2.8.x, GtkSourceView 1.2.0 and GNOME 2.13.x libraries.
pygtk 2.8.x and gnome-python-desktop 2.13.x are required to enable python
plugins support.

Simple install procedure:

  % gzip -cd gedit-2.15.8.tar.gz | tar xvf - 	# unpack the sources
  % cd gedit-2.15.8				# change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure					# run the `configure' script
  % make					# build gedit
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install				# install gedit

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gedit). You will need to create an
account for yourself.

You can also report bugs using the GNOME program bug-buddy.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and gnome libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

See the file 'BUGS' for the list of known bugs.


Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. 
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
