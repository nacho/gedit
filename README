between Nautilus (the GNOME file manager) and the use of the GNOME help system,
the GNOME Virtual File System and the GNOME print framework.

Installation
============

  % gzip -cd gedit2-1.120.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -    # unpack the sources
  % cd gedit-1.120.0			   # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure				   # run the `configure' script

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gedit.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.

You can also report bugs using the GNOME program bug-buddy.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and gnome libraries
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

See the file 'BUGS' for the list of known bugs.


Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. 
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
